# Leap-Motion-Unity-2021
Leap motion error for unity in 2021, failing to compile.

-> The error happens not allowing to play in the environment created with a leap motion, after importing the CORE.

-> This happens because there is a flaw in the Hotkeys.cs file causing some parameters to be obsolete for the new versions and preventing the core from running.
